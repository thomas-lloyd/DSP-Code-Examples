# DSP-Code-Examples

## Overview

Contained here are various code examples for implementing basic DSP algorithms using Python.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3
  * You will need an installation of Python 3 along with the necessary libraries for Numpy (numerical python), Scipy (scientific python) and matplotlib.  I recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which comes with all these libraries along with a nice command line and IDE.

* A book about DSP theory.
  * I recommend getting a book that covers the general theory behind the functions that are being discussed in these lessons.  I recommend [this](https://www.theiet.org/resources/books/circuits/18982.cfm).
