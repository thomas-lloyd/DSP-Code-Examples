# DSP-Code-Examples - Lesson 0

## Overview
This lesson covers some basic Python/programming concepts necessary for coding DSP algorithms.  Most of the topics covered this repository utilise existing libraries, so it is important to understand how to import and them and use them.  While it is important to understand exactly what these libraries are doing, the main focus of these lessons is to demonstrate how you can easily analyse and process signals without having to spend hours coding all the algorithms from scratch. There are _plenty_ of better materials out there for general Python learning.  I recommend [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).  In fact you _definitely_ want to check that out first.
## Importing Relevant libraries.
As mentioned in the overview, the examples in this repository will mainly utilise existing libraries where the algorithms have been written for you.  The main three libraries that will be used are:

* NumPy (Numerical Python)
    * Numerical algorithms such as FFT and convolution
* SciPy (Scientific Python)
    * Various functions such as wav file importing and statistics
* Matplotlib
    * Used for plotting graphs and visualising data

For Numpy, you generally import the whole thing like this:
```python
import numpy as np
```
Here the term `np` is used as abbreviation.  For example the convolution function can now be called as `np.convolve()` instead of `numpy.convolve()`
