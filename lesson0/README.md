# DSP-Code-Examples - Lesson 0

## Overview
This lesson covers some basic Python/programming concepts necessary for coding DSP algorithms.  There are _plenty_ of better materials out there for general Python learning.  I recommend [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).  In fact you _definitely_ want to check that out first.
