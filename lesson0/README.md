# DSP-Code-Examples - Lesson 0

## Overview
This lesson covers some basic Python/programming concepts necessary for coding DSP algorithms.  Most of the topics covered this repository utilise existing libraries, so it is important to understand how to import and them and use them.  There are _plenty_ of better materials out there for general Python learning.  I recommend [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).  In fact you _definitely_ want to check that out first.
## Importing Relevant libraries.
As mentioned in the overview, the examples in this repository will mainly utilise existing libraries where the algorithms have been written for you.  The main three libraries that will be used are:

* NumPy (Numerical Python)
    * Numerical algorithms such as FFT and convolution
* SciPy (Scientific Python)
    * Various functions such as wav file importing and statistics
* Matplotlib
    * Used for plotting graphs and visualising data

## Assigning Variables.

## Creating an Array.

## Basic Mathematics.
